current implementation for reading and building a list of "sorted" movie objects by tconst raises some
uncertainty for the size of the data set not sure
if the list becomes unsorted during file reading and object creation considering
the data is sorted by "tconst" values using python pandas

current benchmarks for ONLY movie creation equates to about ~60 -70 seconds for objects to be created
perhaps because the code is not fully optimized and furthermore is not and will not be multithreaded
therefore tasks will only run on the single main thread

consumes ~.6/.65 gb to completely load the dataset


~1gb consumed in ram for loading of actors
load time == ~1 min 30/40 sec.

58 + 50.5 + 10

output number of collisions during the hashing
the numbers generated during the hash for the key
the time of the operation for completion

questions to be answered:
1) is the modulus operation inefficient in the current algorithm
2) is the current inefficiency/slowness the result of uni-directional quad-probing?
3) can psuedo-rand be a better alternative?
4) can another map layer of key maps be better?
5) is the unix_elf hashing inefficient?


benchmarks:
- FileIO::buildMovieTitles_sortedByID
	lines in file = ~377,930
	duration: ~11.1/11.5 seconds



loading data into the database wrapper classs
1) Run ff. concurr:
--> create list of movies sorted by their title value // presorted from data set
--> create a list of actors 
--> create list of sorted movieIDs // sorted via data set 
2) Add movies into table such that titles are keys
3) Map the list of movie pointers to table data?
4)
