# Context Indexing Movie Search Engine
This program was written for my data structures class in 2019 as a final project. Our professor provided constraints requiring utilization of in-house written data structures to build an application, in this case, it was a movie search engine. <br>

## Data structures used:
* Singly Linked List
* Stack
* HashTable (Quadratic Probing)
* BinarySearchTree
