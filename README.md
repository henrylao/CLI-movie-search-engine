# Context Indexing Movie Search Engine
This program was written for DeAnza's CS301 Data Structures class in 2019 as a final project. Constraints required utilization of an in-house implementation of template data structures used in the development of the application. The application is a CLI interface for interacting with a database of movies using the database's search engine.

# Data Structures Used
* Singly Linked List
* Stack
* HashTable (Quadratic Probing)
* Binary Search Tree
